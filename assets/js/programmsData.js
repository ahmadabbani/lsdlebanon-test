    description: `Human rights are rights inherent to all human beings, whatever our nationality, place of residence, sex, national or ethnic origin, color, religion, language, or any other status. We are all equally entitled to our human rights without discrimination. These rights are all interrelated, interdependent and indivisible.

Universal human rights are often expressed and guaranteed by law, in the forms of treaties, customary international law, general principles and other sources of international law. International human rights law lays down obligations of Governments to act in certain ways or to refrain from certain acts, in order to promote and protect human rights and fundamental freedoms of individuals or groups.

Human rights have become the moral language of today, the idiom in which we discuss our common humanity and weigh competing claims for resources, rights and protections.

Are we promoting human rights and forgetting the human being?

Therefore, the Human Rights Advocacy program seeks to promote the culture of human rights through a cumulative participatory process in which individuals, notably citizens, are empowered enough to become actors of change in their respective communities. The HRA program is based on an experiential learning and participatory approach through which the participant gets to experience and reflect on certain situations and then relate them to true-life situations they have been through as human beings.`,
