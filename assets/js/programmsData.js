    description: `Human rights are rights inherent to all human beings, whatever our nationality, place of residence, sex, national or ethnic origin, color, religion, language, or any other status. We are all equally entitled to our human rights without discrimination. These rights are all interrelated, interdependent and indivisible.

Universal human rights are often expressed and guaranteed by law, in the forms of treaties, customary international law, general principles and other sources of international law. International human rights law lays down obligations of Governments to act in certain ways or to refrain from certain acts, in order to promote and protect human rights and fundamental freedoms of individuals or groups.

Human rights have become the moral language of today, the idiom in which we discuss our common humanity and weigh competing claims for resources, rights and protections.

Are we promoting human rights and forgetting the human being?

Therefore, the Human Rights Advocacy program seeks to promote the culture of human rights through a cumulative participatory process in which individuals, notably citizens, are empowered enough to become actors of change in their respective communities. The HRA program is based on an experiential learning and participatory approach through which the participant gets to experience and reflect on certain situations and then relate them to true-life situations they have been through as human beings.`,

    description: `In a diversified society, developing a programmatic response to peace building priorities is a multi-step process that requires conflict analysis, including a consideration of the specific ways in which conflict impacts genders differently; a theory of change; an informed risk assessment, and a robust monitoring and evaluation framework.

Since we cannot find peace by avoiding conflict, LSD believes that Conflict transformation is a long-term, gradual and complex process, requiring sustained engagement and interaction. It is not just an approach and set of techniques, but a way of thinking about and understanding conflict itself.

In the process of promoting peace, conflict transformation invariably involves a third, impartial party, in order to help actors alter their cognitive and emotional views on the ‘Other’, thereby helping to break down divisions towards a clear understanding of the richness of the Lebanese diversity.`,

    description: `The Leadership for Sustainable Development team stresses on the importance of mental health and well-being, especially when it comes to the younger generation. Mental health is the basis of a good thinking process and LSD sets it as a priority now particularly due to all that has been happening in our country and worldwide: the Covid-19 pandemic, quarantine, economic crisis, high unemployment rates, etc.

We support the youth through personal leadership which should be built upon values and a purpose in life and we provide youth-friendly services while accounting for the complex socio-economic factors which affect young people’s mental health and well-being. We work on raising mental health awareness and planting resilience and hope in the youth’s heart so that they can become better future leaders.`,

    description: `Big changes begin with small steps, and so, to build a better Lebanon, we have to start with each individual becoming a better citizen. A good citizen reflects his/her values onto society, as an active and responsible part of their community. Also, it is one of the priorities of good citizenship to embrace diversity and accept it as one of the advantages of our society. Therefore, the Citizenship and Civil engagement program helps people understand their rights and their responsibilities towards their community and works on fortifying equality, unity, and promoting peace between the Lebanese people.`,

    description: `Responding to the growing humanitarian need in Lebanon especially after the economic crisis and the Covid-19 negative impact on the society that led to a high rate of unemployment, LSD works towards attending to the health, social and physical needs of the most vulnerable people within its network. Our primary aim is to provide support services that recognize the dignity of human beings and to treat them under the mutual respect as equal citizens reflecting our ethics and values.`,
