    description: `As many LDF Fellows, Michel El Daccache described the Leaders for Democracy Fellowship (LDF) program as a turning point in his life. The LDF experience was a milestone for multiple and enriching opportunities that helped shape his growing career. The program allowed him to develop his civic action plan and transform it into a manual that helps people understand the technicalities and practicalities of voting in Lebanon especially after the new 2018 elections law.
    
    During Michel’s participation in the U.S. LDF program’s professional practicum component, he was placed with IFES where he developed and administered a survey about the engagement of Lebanese citizens in politics. This survey was a stepping stone towards his CAP. In 12 days, he reached 550 respondents which surprised IFES and helped increase his credibility with the organization.
    
    With the experience gained through LDF, Michel used his NGO, the Leadership for Sustainable Development, as an outlet to give trainings in two Lebanese villages (Hayata and Ghbaleh). The aim of the trainings was to simplify and clarify the new electoral voting system. To his surprise, the result of his training was easily captured in the election turnout where there was an 80% voter turnout in these two villages while Lebanon in total saw a 49.2% voting turnout. Moreover, one of these two villages had a 0-canceled vote while the other village had only 20 canceled votes.  These numbers are minuscule compared to the 35,000 canceled votes that Lebanon saw after the election results were announced. This proved that his manual and trainings helped people understand the new electoral law better and vote accordingly.
    
    Michel believes in creating a generation of leaders and elevating a positive influence on the societal and political level. Michel’s future plans consist of working on government accountability. He plans on creating an online platform that will give the citizens the possibility to hold accountable the newly elected candidates. In the meantime he continues to motivate youth and engage them in their communities.`,

Leadership for Sustainable Development – LSD took part in this consultation with experts from government ministries, representatives from specified syndicates and unions, the private sector, civil society organizations and academia, to brainstorm ideas, projects and policy proposals that can contribute to the development of Lebanon’s new national action plan that will be published towards the end of the year 2019.
    
    The national consultations took place across nine workshops held throughout 2019, designed to engage a cross section of Lebanese society in the development of a national action plan to prevent the spread of extremist ideas. This national action plan addressed the wide range of economic and social conditions that allow extremism to breed including a lack of economic opportunities, perceptions of inequality and a lack of trust.
    
    The Republic of Lebanon’s National Strategy for Preventing Violent Extremism was ratified in March 2018 following an extensive process of cross-government dialogue and engagement involving all twenty-nine government ministries.
    
    The strategy defines extremism as, the spread of individual and collective hatred that may lead to social violence; and the rejection of diversity and non-acceptance of the other, and the use of violence as a means of expression and influence. In addition to a behavior that threatens societal values ensuring social stability.
    
    In response, it puts the concept of Prevention at the heart of the approach – aiming to tackle the problem at source rather than responding to it once it’s too late. It proposes to take action across a range of different policy areas in order to address the underlying social and economic factors in Lebanese society that allow extremism to breed.
    
    By addressing the underlying conditions in each area that provide the fertile ground for extremism to flourish, the strategy aims to make individuals, families and communities increasingly resilient to the lure of violent extremism, and to enhance the economic well-being of the country too especially on the Youth level.
    
    After this workshop, the objectives were targeted and raised the youth awareness on PVE and building their capacity on community service, volunteerism and sports initiatives. In addition to improve the youth employability and entrepreneurial skills to prepare them for the labour market. Also, involving young people in decision and policy making at the national and local levels.

    Democracy building and participation of young people in Euro Med: a difficult but extremely important topic that has to lead to reflection and action for a better future. We, young people, are claiming democracy in our countries, seeking for applicable solutions and motivated to express our right to cooperate and talk about our thoughts, inclinations and issues… but we encounter exclusion from democratic processes, and our voices are not heard. On the other side, indeed, the “tomorrow” belongs to us and to the fact of being the future leaders of peaceful countries, collaborating, inclusive, social, political – but still, we do not get involved into democratic processes in our countries.
    
    Leadership for Sustainable Development NGO, representing Lebanon by its President Mr. Michel Daccache and its Lebanese team in this project where they will join young activists and experts from Italy, Tunisia, Spain, Jordan, Greece, Poland and Palestine, to strengthen understanding and action for democracy and human rights in order to develop their skills, knowledge and experience on the decision making level by realizing the fundamental democratic right of participation in Euro Med.
    
    Finally, as Martin Luther King Jr. said once: “Let us not seek to satisfy our thirst for freedom by drinking from the cup of bitterness and hatred”, Democracy is worth it.`,

    description: `Since the Taif Agreement, the Lebanese electoral law is based on the majority system. This law that suffers from several gaps and flaws, set the development of democracy and political life in an unstable condition and does not provide opportunities for proper participation and representation.
    
    In addition, since 2009 Lebanon has not witnessed any parliamentary elections but a mandate renewal of the Parliament which posed controversy.
    
    After great efforts that lasted for years, In June 2017 the Lebanese people’ representatives finally reached and adopted a new electoral law.
    
    Since the “responsibilization” and accountability principles in the political sector requires the understanding of the reality of democratic participation in political life, the NGO, Leadership for Sustainable Development (LSD) seeks to simplify and explain the relative electoral law to the Lebanese citizens since we believe in the importance of participating in political life and encouraging individuals to participate in elections, Put the voter’s guide in your hands to explain the law of parliamentary elections.
    
    This guide seeks to explain the electoral law to the Lebanese citizens in order to facilitate the complete voting and tallying process of the new law.
    
    For further information regarding the Voter’s Guide, don’t hesitate to contact our administration.
    
    This Voter’s Guide has been worked on, in a scientific and simple manner and its full ownership is attributed to the Leadership for Sustainable Development organization.`,
